# Interest-Based Content Recommendation System

This repository contains my submission for the **ML Intern Assignment** at **Ambrix Lifemedia**.  
The task was to design a recommendation system that suggests **top 3 posts per user** based on user profile, past engagement, and post attributes.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
- Recommend top 3 posts for each user.
- Use profile interests, past engagement, and content attributes.
- Datasets provided:
  - Users.csv
  - Posts.csv
  - Engagements.csv

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
.
â”œâ”€â”€ recommendation_system.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook with full pipeline
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                     # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ data/                         # Users, Posts, Engagements CSVs (if included)
